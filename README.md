Pokemon for Data Science
Using the Pokemon Dataset for playing with and grokking different libraries and exploratory analysis/machine learning (how can I apply ML on Pokemon? No idea (yet)).

Some libraries of my interest:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
bokeh
holoviz (https://github.com/holoviz-community/HoloViz_KDD2022)
scikit-learn
tensorflow
turicreate

Notice: I may interchangeably use english and brazilian portuguese in my commentaries, as I don't particularly keep tabs on what language I'm using for thinking. Also, this is supposed to be merely a toy project. Sorry if this may inconvenience you.
