Pokemon for Data Science<br><br>
Using the Pokemon Dataset for playing with and grokking different libraries and exploratory analysis/machine learning (how can I apply ML on Pokemon? No idea (yet)).<br>
Used the dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon.
<br>
Some libraries of my interest:<br>
<br>
pandas<br>
numpy<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
bokeh<br>
holoviz (https://github.com/holoviz-community/HoloViz_KDD2022)<br>
scikit-learn<br>
tensorflow<br>
turicreate<br>
<br>
Notice: I may interchangeably use english and brazilian portuguese in my commentaries, as I don't particularly keep tabs on what language I'm using for thinking. Also, this is supposed to be merely a toy project. Sorry if this may inconvenience you.
